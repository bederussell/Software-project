### Strategies used to respond to difficulties
When developing an AI autocomplete model, programmers can run into numerous time/resource difficulties that affect how effective the program is for the client's needs. Some strategies to respond to these difficulties and ensure an effective solution for the client include:
* Finding a solution online: something I experienced a lot during the early stages of my project was having a lack of knowledge about how to code a neural network and what libraries/modules to import in order to satisfy the needs of my program. A solution I used was intensive research and trial and error of different neural network solutions I found online (e.g. different options of libraries such as tensorflow, pytorch, sklearn etc.). Finding solutions online can be enlightening and educating about the unseen implications and needs of your project; something which was very prevalent in my planning & research phase, as I realised I bit off more than I could chew when designing my project without proper research.
* Collaboration with peers: collaborating on a project with multiple developers/designers can be extremely effective in responding to time difficulties due to the efficiency of splitting up tasks so the load isn't as heavy on a singular developer. In my project I had to assign all the work to myself, which ended up in a lot of stress to adequately complete every section of the project on time. Ideally, to respond to the problem of time constraints and deadlines when developing a machine learning chatbot model, each section of the project would be split up into teams - ie having a research team to take a load off the programmers, and assigning small chunks of work to multiple developers in order to efficiently create the software solution in time.
* Outsourcing: another significant problem in creating an ML chatbot that satisfies the needs of the client is having enough appropriate data to train the model to ensure it serves the right purpose. I spent a lot of time scraping the web for text data to train the model - however the real challenge was finding an appropriate data type to split and store the training data in order to feed it into the ML model in order to begin training. A way to respond to this challenge is outsourcing text data and purchasing a specialised training data set from an external retailer to reduce the time and effort on developers to find their own, allowing more time for programming and testing before the deadline.
