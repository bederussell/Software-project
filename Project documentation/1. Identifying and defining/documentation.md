# Identifying and Defining
### Requirements
##### Functional Requirements
- User can input a string of text and the model will use Natural Language Processing to breakdown and understand the text so it cn predict an output.
- The model will predict the best response to the inputted text and generate a response that satisfies the most accuracy and least error, based on the training data.
- The model can (hopefully) sustain a somewhat intelligable conversation with the user, or at least generate a prediction of each text input, expressed in natural language

##### Non-functional Requirements
- The model can generate a response in less than 10 seconds
- The model can handle an input of up to 500 tokens
- The model can handle colloquial language, including words with contractions and spelling errors
