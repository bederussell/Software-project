# Research and Planning
### Possible Development Approaches
Explained below are how the three different software development approaches (Waterfall, Agile, WAgile) could be used in the management of my project.
##### Waterfall
The Waterfall approach is a linear, sequential process where project requirements are rigidly and explicitly determined before development begins, and these requirements are fixed and unchanging. The waterfall approach is a very direct methodology as developers follow the software lice cycle steps (identifying, planning, producing, testing, etc.) in a discrete fashion where one step is completely finished before the next begins (much like how a waterfall falls sequentially without overlapping itself). A waterfall approach to development allows for a clear, focused software life cycle and enables developers to be efficient in documentation and execution of the different development steps. As for my project, a waterfall-based development approach could potentially work during the early stages of development (defining/planning), as it allows me to have a clear idea for what I want my project to look like and how I want the finished product to work. Although the waterfall approach enables me to be efficient during planning stages, it can be highly limiting during the later steps of my project (developing/testing), as there is a large learning curve to creating an ML chatbot, and there are hundreds of different strategies, models, and datasets I can use to build and train the model. The waterfall approach will not be effective in this area of my project as I anticipate a large amount of backtracking, debugging, and re-designing of algorithms during the production of the chatbot, something which Waterfall does not support.

##### Agile
The Agile approach is a dynamic, iterative process where the development of the project is highly influenced by client feedback and testing. The software development steps (planning, producing, testing) are often not chronological, with re-planning and common evaluations of the software being sprinkled into all aspects of the project development. The agile approach promotes collaboration and small increments between different development steps, and although is usually is more resource heavy than waterfall due to the frequency of testing, feedback, and design amendments, can produce a final product that is overall less risky and better fitting the needs of the client than a waterfall counterpart due to the high degree of collaboration. As for my project, an Agile approach is very appropriate due to the complexity and learning curve of building an ML model; and frequent changes to the design and production of code is necessary in order for me to learn how to effectively build a model that satisfies the requirements. However, the downside to Agile is that it usually takes a much longer timeframe as I am constantly rebuilding both the foundation and fine tunings of the model until I find a solution that works, meaning this methodology could result in an unfinished project by the deadline. 

##### WAgile
The WAgile approach is a combination of both Waterfall and Agile, and focuses on integrating both sequential and flexible methodologies. WAgile consists of allowing a project's development to be consistently reviewed and refined whilst maintaining a firm structure of static project requirements and and predefined development stages. This includes adapting code solutions to current feedback and exploring alternate possibilities of solutions, whilst keeping a focus on linear documentation and deadlines. This methodology will most likely work best for me as I can utilise this development approach in all stages of my project; the first few steps of development would work best with Waterfall (establishing a firm definition and structure of how I can develop the project), and the later steps would be most effective utilising Agile principles (constantly evaluating code and test data, and amending the paramteres of my model to make it consistently better over time).

Overall, a WAgile approach with a focus on Waterfall during design phases and Agile during implementing phases would work best for my project, enabling me to produce a well-working model that fits initial requirements and deadlines whilst also being tailored to current feedback to ensure maximum efficiecy of the ML model.
